# Note: eventually the 'id' should be turned into something that does not give away the case.
#       But for testing, it is nice to be able to quickly see which case you are doing.

# The first case below has comments which explain each field.

    I want you to only reply as the patient.
    When I ask questions, only answer the immediate question.
    Do not give extra information. Do not write explanations.

# Framing is fed to chatGPT as a 'system' message.  It should set the stage for
# the patient encounter, and include any relevent information required for the student
# to correctly interact with the patient.
reminders: Remember to act as a patient with a common cold but do not tell me you have a common cold.
# Because chatGPT can sometimes forget, the "reminders" are fed in with each interaction
# to keep the AI on track.  If you notice the AI has a tendency to forget something you can add
# it to the reminders.
notes: Adult Cold, should end with the support staff discussing supportive care.
